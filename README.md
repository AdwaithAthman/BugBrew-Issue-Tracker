# BugBrew
BugBrew was developed with the primary goal of gaining a deeper understanding of Next.js, and it encapsulates all the essential features of modern applications. 
From a comprehensive dashboard with charts to client-side validated forms, user authentication, and access control, this app is a testament to the versatility and power of Next.js.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
